  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">
    Estimate your one-rep max (1RM) based on your performance with submaximal weights. This
    calculator uses various formulas to predict your maximum lifting capacity, helping you track
    progress and set appropriate training weights without having to perform potentially risky
    maximal lifts. Useful for all major compound movements and isolation exercises.
